Accessing Edibles
=================

* What edibles are ready to harvest right now?
* Which ones are near my location?
* What does it look like?
* How do I harvest & prepare it?
* What can I do with it now? (recipes, fermentation)
* How can I give back? (connect to other projects)

Submitting Edibles
==================

* I have or found something with abundant fruit
* How do add it to the database?
* I know this about it:
  - Common name
  - Where it is
  - Status (ripe, no leaves, etc.)
  - Permissions (I own it, public land, hanging over sidewalk)
  - Potential risks (sprayed, tall tree, dogs)
  - My personal experience & notes
* I might know a little more:
  - Photo(s)
  - Species name
  - More specific location (click on map)
* I might have time to contribute:
  - Harvesting & preparation info
  - Recipes, tips, medicinal uses
  - History
  - Links
* I am now a user because I gave:
  - A name
  - Email
  - An auto generated password that can be changed (?)
